So many broken dreams.
So many broken hearts.
So many lives come together,
Just to fall apart.
And I,
I just wanted to see your face.
I never understood why you left with such haste.
Why do I feel like it was all such a waste?
What could I have done to cause my fall from grace?
Couldn't I have at least seen your face?

So many broken dreams.
So many broken hearts.
So many lives come together,
Just to fall apart.
And I,
I just wanted to say "goodbye".
You never listened when I said "hello".
You always acted like to had to go.
What more could I have done to try?
Couldn't I have at least seen your face?

So many broken dreams.
So many broken hearts.
So many lives come together,
Just to fall apart.
And I,
I just wanted to love you always.
I never understood why you ran away.
I always thought there was more that I had to say.
But our plans are so different these days.
Couldn't I have at least seen your face?
