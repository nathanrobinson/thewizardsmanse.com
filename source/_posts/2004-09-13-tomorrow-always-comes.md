I don't want to leave anymore.
I don't want to run anymore.
I don't want to bleed anymore.
I just wish that I could stay.

But tomorrow always comes,
And I always walk away.
Tomorrow always comes,
And there's nothing I can say,
Because tomorrow always comes.

I don't want to hurt you anymore.
I don't want to make you cry.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I just wish that I knew why.

But tomorrow always comes,
And I always walk away.
Tomorrow always comes,
And there's nothing I can say,
Because tomorrow always comes.

I don't want to find another love.
I don't want to make you cry.
I don't want to lose another love.
I just wish that I could win.

But tomorrow always comes,
And I always walk away.
Tomorrow always comes,
And there's nothing I can say,
Because tomorrow always comes.

I don't want to bleed anymore.
I just wish that I could stay.
