D        Am             G
It was a call I'd never heard before
D         Am              G
But one I knew I couldn't resist
D          Am               G
And now it seems I need you more and more
D         Am                 G
How can a heart like mine be blessed

A                                     Bm
Sometimes the wondering thoughts that cloud my mind
C                        G
Seem to take too long to clear
A                            Bm
But when I see the love that Youve shone me
C                          G
I know the One that I hold dear

D         Am                G
Enough to hear the voice of One so pure
D           Am             G
And see the beacon of Your love
D           Am              G
To have You cleanse away my every sore
D            Am         G
And see Your glory from above

A                                     Bm
Sometimes the wondering thoughts that cloud my mind
C                        G
Seem to take too long to clear
A                            Bm
But when I see the love that Youve shone me
C                          G
I know the One that I hold dear

D        Am    G
Each and every time I fail
D             Am            G
Sticks like a thorn into my side
D          Am        G
But when I feel like Im so frail
D          Am             G
I remember that's why You died

A                                     Bm
Sometimes the wondering thoughts that cloud my mind
C                        G
Seem to take too long to clear
A                            Bm
But when I see the love that Youve shone me
C                          G
I know the One that I hold dear
