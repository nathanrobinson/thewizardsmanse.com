I know you
Better than you think
<!--more-->
Youre never sad and lonely
Cause youve always got your shrink
I saw you
Crying all the time
Then you took those pills
And told me everything was fine

Crazy girl
You always run away
Even though you love me
Even though you want to stay

I know you
I met you long ago
You told me that you loved me
But you never let it show
You told me
Youd never want to leave
Another heart's been broken
Guess that's how it had to be

Crazy girl
You always run away
Even though you love me
Even though you want to stay

I know you
The way you play with me
The things that you wont show me
But that I can clearly see
I know you
Better than you think
If you want to leave me
Then I think youll need your shrink

Crazy girl
You always run away
Even though you love me
Even though you want to stay
