I know I should love you by now
But what if I don't
<!--more-->
What if I don't want to think that Ill ever know how
What if I don't

What if I don't
What would you do
What if I don't want to
Let all my hopes and dreams fall through
What if I don't

I know I should want you near me
But what if I don't
What if I don't want to be the man you want me to be
What if I don't

What if I don't
What would you do
What if I don't want to
Let all my hopes and dreams fall through
What if I don't

I know you want me to go
But what if I don't
What if I don't want to be the one whos always alone
What if I don't

What if I don't
What would you do
What if I don't want to
Let all my hopes and dreams fall through
What if I don't
