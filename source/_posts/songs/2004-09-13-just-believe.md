Temptation circles like a shark,
Waiting for the first sign of weakness.
<!--more-->
While safety floats just out of reach,
Attained only by humility and meekness.

So swimming away
Might take all my strength,
But my strength comes from God,
If I'll just believe.

Confusing the good with the bad,
Is a fate that seems worse than death.
The only way out is to praise the Lord,
But I must praise Him with every breath.

So swimming away
Might take all my strength,
But my strength comes from God,
If I'll just believe.

Breath doesn't come so easily sometimes,
And death can be so hard to achieve,
But walking straight and serving Him
Comes is I'll just believe.

So swimming away
Might take all my strength,
But my strength comes from God,
If I'll just believe.
