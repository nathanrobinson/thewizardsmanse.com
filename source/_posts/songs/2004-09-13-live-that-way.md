A wounded head and a damaged pride,
Is all I have to show for this fight.
<!--more-->
And like the old man once said,
"Another day older and deeper in debt."
But when you sent You Son to save
You said I was no longer a slave.
So why do I still feel that way?

A little more pain and a little less pride
To clean the open wounds left from this fight.
And all I'm asking from You
Is to help me do what You want me to do.
When You tell me I'm no longer a slave,
Why is that still so hard to believe?
So will I ever live that way?

Another time or another place.
Maybe one more trial to steady my pace.
Another prayer or maybe two,
And hope the answer comes from You
That You'll tell me I'm no longer a slave,
That that's the way that I will live.
And I will always live that way!

A little more pain and a little less pride
To clean the open wounds left from this fight.
And all I'm asking from You
Is to help me do what You want me to do.
When You tell me I'm no longer a slave,
Why is that still so hard to believe?
So will I ever live that way?
