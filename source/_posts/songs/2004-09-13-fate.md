I thought I'd found forever,
But forever never came
<!--more-->
And now I know tomorrow
Was just another game.

Another simple question
I never got to ask.
Another broken heart
Because I moved too fast.
A simple little question
But now it's way too late.
Tomorrow has been stolen
But I guess that it was fate.

I thought I'd found forever,
But forever never came.
And I never figured out
Just where to place the blame.

Another simple question
I never got to ask.
Another broken heart
Because I moved too fast.
A simple little question
But now it's way too late.
Tomorrow has been stolen
But I guess that it was fate.

I thought that I could love you,
And I thought you'd love me too,
But I never thought tomorrow
Would leave me without you.

Another simple question
I never got to ask.
Another broken heart
Because I moved too fast.
A simple little question
But now it's way too late.
Tomorrow has been stolen
But I guess that it was fate.
