She said "I'm sorry"
He said "That's fine"
<!--more-->
She said "I love you,
But I don't have the time"

And so they're finished
They both just walk away
They're always finished
When they have nothing left to say

She said "It's over"
He said "I know"
He said "You hurt me
But I can't let you go"

And so they're finished
They both just walk away
They're always finished
When they have nothing left to say

She said "Hello, dear"
He said "Hello"
She said "I missed you,
Plus I have nowhere else to go"

A new beginning
Began again
But these beginnings
Are always finished in the end

And so they're finished
They both just walk away
They're always finished
When they have nothing left to say
