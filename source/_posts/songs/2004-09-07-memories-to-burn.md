Burn a thousand memories
But never let them fade
<!--more-->
I spend so long wishing for these
But these wishes tend to jade

Spring is time to begin again
So tell me that I'm new
So I'll begin to wish again
And burn some memories of you

She's got loves, She's got slaves
She got memories to burn
But of the memories she saves
She's got too much to learn
So she's got memories to burn

Burn a thousand memories
But never let them fade
Waking up to see your face
Kills the wished that I've made

So give me time to begin again
Some time to find the truth
When I'm I'll return
To the memories of you

She's got loves, She's got slaves
She got memories to burn
But of the memories she saves
She's got too much to learn
So she's got memories to burn

Tell me I'm the only one
Never let me fade
Don't burn the memories
Of the life that we've made

She's got loves, She's got slaves
She got memories to burn
But of the memories she saves
She's got too much to learn
So she's got memories to burn
