One thing I thought I knew,
That you'd never go away.
<!--more-->
Like a simple-minded loser
I believed the things you'd say.
I never stopped assuming
That you'd be here to stay.
So I guess that trusting you
Was my first mistake.

Play me now,
I am the fool again.
I never found out
When it all began.
I can't see you,
In all your ugly sin.
Play me now,
I am the fool again.

I never saw you coming,
The way you come to me,
Like a devil or a dozer
Or a ton of TNT.
And then you left me leveled
As you went you your way.
So I guess that trusting you
Was my first mistake.

Play me now,
I am the fool again.
I never found out
When it all began.
I can't see you,
In all your ugly sin.
Play me now,
I am the fool again.

And I feel like such a fool
Every time you walk away,
But still I take you back,
And keep repeating my mistakes.

Play me now,
I am the fool again.
I never found out
When it all began.
I can't see you,
In all your ugly sin.
Play me now,
I am the fool again.
