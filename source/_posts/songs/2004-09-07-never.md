Never let your sun go down
Never let your light go out
<!--more-->
Never stop they way you sing
Never be afraid to shout

You can walk away from me
You can say you don't believe
You only showed me what you wanted me to see
But you can't tell me that you wanted to leave

Never let your sun go down
Never let your light go out
Never stop they way you sing
Never be afraid to shout

As my memory starts to faid
I can still see your face
People say the price was to high to have paid
But I know youll never fall from my grace

Never let your sun go down
Never let your light go out
Never stop they way you sing
Never be afraid to shout

Never let your sun go down
Never let your light go out
Never stop they way you sing
Never be afraid to shout
