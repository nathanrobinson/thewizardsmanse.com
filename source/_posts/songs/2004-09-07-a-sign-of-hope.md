I saw him stand there
In his great but trembling stature
<!--more-->
A ray of hope shining in his eye
They tried to kill him
The ones that have no hope left
But he remains alive
Because his hope won't die

A sign of hope is all I ask
Alone my weary heart won't last
I need Your love and strength
To outrun my past
A sign of hope is all I ask

It's a lonely road
The one that leads to freedom
Faced on all sides by your own sin
But when we fall down
Our great and mighty savior
Tells us we will win
If we get back up again

A sign of hope is all I ask
Alone my weary heart won't last
I need Your love and strength
To outrun my past
A sign of hope is all I ask

And we know that we will win
Because He picks us up again

A sign of hope is all I ask
Alone my weary heart won't last
I need Your love and strength
To outrun my past
A sign of hope is all I ask
