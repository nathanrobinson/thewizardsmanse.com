I hear You calling my name

<!--more-->
But I still don't believe
I try to find another sacrifice
That can save my life
One as pure as Yours
But theres no one to be found

So I come to You
Crawling on the ground
Searching for the truth
You're the only truth that Ive found

I hear You calling my name

But still I don't believe
I try to find another way
To give You my heart
And still keep some back for me
But it all belongs to You

So I come again
Asking what to do
Searching for the truth
But You're the only truth Ive found

I hear You calling my name

And I now I can believe
You're the only truth I need
So take away my sin
And keep my heart for You
Theres nothing else that I can do
