What's the matter
Cant relate
<!--more-->
Your lover said that it's too late
Now you're stuck
Wanting some more
Never knowing love for sure
Love was too complicated anyway

Sometimes
You've got to risk it all
You've got to make that call
Or you'll never find your way
So call me
And say that you're OK
Tell me you're OK
Say you'll be OK
You've got to make that call

Why so sad
Was it all fake
Now there's nothing left to take
Where'd you go
D'you run away
Cause youve got nothing left to say
Talking always took too long anyway

Sometimes
You've got to risk it all
You've got to make that call
Or you'll never find your way
So call me
And say that you're OK
Tell me you're OK
Say you'll be OK
You've got to make that call

Where's your heart
Is it black
Can I ever win you back
Can you feel
That you're alone
Is it something youve always known
Being together was too hard anyway

Sometimes
You've got to risk it all
You've got to make that call
Or you'll never find your way
So call me
And say that you're OK
Tell me you're OK
Say you'll be OK
You've got to make that call
