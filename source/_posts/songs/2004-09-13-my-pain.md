My pain,
Can't ever be expressed.
<!--more-->
I live with my grief,
And drown in my regret.
I know,
That I am to blame.
She tells me every time
She dares to say my name.

Will you grieve for me,
Or will you close your eyes?
Will you stop and help,
Or will you pass me by?

Fallen memories,
That I've cast to the side,
Have risen up to kill,
And seek to take my pride.
Fallen memories,
That I've tried to kill,
Have taken all my power,
And stolen all my will.

Will you grieve for me,
Or will you close your eyes?
Will you stop and help,
Or will you pass me by?

My pain,
Can't ever be expressed.
So I'll take what I can get,
And then hope for the best.
She says,
That I am to blame.
That I was too weak,
And I could never change.

Will you grieve for me,
Or will you close your eyes?
Will you stop and help,
Or will you pass me by?
