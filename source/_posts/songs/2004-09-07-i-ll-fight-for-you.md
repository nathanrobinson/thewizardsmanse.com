Another day the sun shines again
I never lose but I never win
<!--more-->
I couldnt escape from this life of sin
Until I met with You

Is the sun still shining
Why cant I see your face
Is it too bright
Or is it too late
What can I do
To make it alright
Is there anything left
For which I should fight

So I'll fight for You

And so I heard a neat little tale
All about how You got pierced with a nail
And when You died You let out a wail
They know not what they do
Was this for me I wish it were true
So many things that I never knew
All these things they say You do
And I never had a clue

Is the sun still shining
Why cant I see your face
Is it too bright
Or is it too late
What can I do
To make it alright
Is there anything left
For which I should fight

So I'll fight for You
I try so hard to do what You want
But all these tasks they just seem to daunt
If I didnt know better Id say its a taunt
I just need help from You
And so it seems that Im on my way
So many things that You want me to say
And when Im stuck and I want to stay
I cry out for Your truth

Is the sun still shining
Why cant I see your face
Is it too bright
Or is it too late
What can I do
To make it alright
Is there anything left
For which I should fight

So I'll fight for You
