Can there still be a way
For someone to ease my pain
<!--more-->
Maybe by something you say
But I don't think it'll come today

I just wanted to talk
Didn't you think I'd call
Why can't we just talk
Is this really all
I just want to talk

The lonely road ahead
With so much left unsaid
I'm stuck here in bed
Maybe I'm better off dead

I just wanted to talk
Didn't you think I'd call
Why can't we just talk
Is this really all
I just want to talk

Where did we go wrong
To lose love for so long
So are you really gone
And here only in my song

I just wanted to talk
Didn't you think I'd call
Why can't we just talk
Is this really all
I just want to talk
