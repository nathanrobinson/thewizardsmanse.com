Maybe, I was just too naive.
Maybe, I saw what I wanted to see.
<!--more-->
Maybe, I thought that she'd never leave.
But I know, she'll be coming back to me.
Because maybe, it's what I have to believe.

I know I was a fool,
But can you really blame me,
When maybe's all I've got
And I've been waiting for so long?

Maybe, I loved her too much.
Maybe, I just miss her touch.
Maybe, my love isn't good as such.
But I hope, She'll be coming back some day.
But maybe, she's really gonna stay away.

I know I was a fool,
But can you really blame me,
When maybe's all I've got
And I've been waiting for so long?

Maybe, I'll be over her some day.
Maybe, is all I've got to say.
Maybe, I'll fall in love again some day,
But I don't think I believe that right now
Because maybe, is all I've ever known.

I know I was a fool,
But can you really blame me,
When maybe's all I've got
And I've been waiting for so long?
