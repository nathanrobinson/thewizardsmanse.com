Have you ever known that feeling
When you knew your love was gone
<!--more-->
Does my touch still seem appealing
Tell me where did I go wrong

Do you think that you still love me
Do you think that you can stay
Is there love enough to hug me
Or should I turn and walk away

All the time that I've spent guessing
I wish I could have known for sure
But I thought guessing was a blessing
When you kept walking out the door

Have you ever known that feeling
When someone you love just walked away
Has the person left you reeling
Because you wished that they would stay

All this time I thought I knew you
I thought you'd never let me down
Because I thought that you would be true
When you said you'd always be around

All the time that I've spent guessing
I wish I could have known for sure
But I thought guessing was a blessing
When you kept walking out the door

Have you ever know that feeling
When you knew you'd just lost a friend
There was no time left for healing
Because you wanted it to end

All the time that I've spent guessing
I wish I could have known for sure
But I thought guessing was a blessing
When you kept walking out the door
