My dreams
So brittle and so weak
<!--more-->
So small and incomplete
I just want to meet
Someone whos like You
But theres no one else like You

Dreams can come and go
Your plans Ill never know
But You love is what You show
And Your blood will always flow
For everything I've done

Your love
So warm and so sweet
In everything I see
I just want to be
Someone whos like You
But Ill never be like You

Dreams can come and go
Your plans Ill never know
But You love is what You show
And Your blood will always flow
For everything I've done

Your plans
So full and complete
Containing plans for me
I think I just need
Someone whos like You
I guess that I need You

Dreams can come and go
Your plans Ill never know
But You love is what You show
And Your blood will always flow
For everything I've done
