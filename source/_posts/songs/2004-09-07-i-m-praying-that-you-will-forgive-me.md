It's so hard to say I'm sorry.
Don't You just know how I feel?
<!--more-->
This time I think I went too far.
I wish this wasn't for real.
It's hard to keep a lid on things,
When they tend to come boiling out.
It's hard for me to hold it in,
When all I'm feeling just wants me to shout.

So I'm praying that You will forgive me
And let me back into You presence once again.
I know You've heard me before, but please don't close the door,
Because I need to get out of the rain.
These snares that keep pulling me under,
I've learned that I cannot resist,
But You've given me power to stand every hour,
And I thank You for making me fit.

Can You see a poor and broken man,
Or is my pride still lingering on?
If I cry out, will You hear what I say,
Or are all my chances already gone?
So forgiveness is so hard to ask for,
When I think of all that I've done.
But the fear that I feel when I know You are coming
Makes my legs to weak to run.

So I'm praying that You will forgive me
And let me back into You presence once again.
I know You've heard me before, but please don't close the door,
Because I need to get out of the rain.
These snares that keep pulling me under,
I've learned that I cannot resist,
But You've given me power to stand every hour,
And I thank You for making me fit.

Can You tell me that You still love me,
Or is that not allowed?
Have I crossed that fine line that requires my life,
Or can I still turn around?
It seems sometimes when we're talking,
One side never gets said.
But my heart isn't cold and I'm not too old
To hear You or have You read.

So I'm praying that You will forgive me
And let me back into You presence once again.
I know You've heard me before, but please don't close the door,
Because I need to get out of the rain.
These snares that keep pulling me under,
I've learned that I cannot resist,
But You've given me power to stand every hour,
And I thank You for making me fit.
