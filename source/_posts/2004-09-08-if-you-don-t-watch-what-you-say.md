I turned twentythree that day
She was twentytwo.
I knew all the things to say
But now what to do.
Hiding behind broken pictures
Of how life should have been
Never hurt quite as much
As thinking that I didn't win.

But love it seems is a fickle thing.
I couldn't keep it in a cage.
I could never make it do what I wanted
Because it always escaped.
And true friends are hard to come by
So why'd I throw this one away?
Enemies are so easy to make
If you don't watch what you say.

I thought of her again today.
It has been so long
Since I said those things before
I know now I was wrong.
Hoping to take things back I've said
Never seems to work.
Apologies I always dread
But can they heal the hurt?

But love it seems is a fickle thing.
I couldn't keep it in a cage.
I could never make it do what I wanted
Because it always escaped.
And true friends are hard to come by
So why'd I throw this one away?
Enemies are so easy to make
If you don't watch what you say.

Hoping that we can move on
Doesn't mean hoping to be friends.
I'm just hoping to make it right
So we can have a decent end.
I never meant to hurt the one I loved.
I guess I just forgot who I was
And I forgot my Hope from above
And that it was always His love.

But love it seems is a fickle thing.
I couldn't keep it in a cage.
I could never make it do what I wanted
Because it always escaped.
And true friends are hard to come by
So why'd I throw this one away?
Enemies are so easy to make
If you don't watch what you say.
