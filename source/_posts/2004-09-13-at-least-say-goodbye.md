It used to be when I'd wake up,
I'd give you a little kiss,
And tell you that you'd be missed
As I walked out to start my day.
But I knew that something was wrong,
When I found that you were gone.
And I just had this to say:

If you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
At least tell me why.
Don't' just walk away.
And if you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
Even if you have to cry.
Don't just leave this way.
At least say "good bye."

It used to be when I'd come home,
I'd give you a little kiss,
And bring you a little gift,
And tell you about my day.
But this time I'm all alone,
It just doesn't feel like home.
And I just have this to say:

If you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
At least tell me why.
Don't' just walk away.
And if you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
Even if you have to cry.
Don't just leave this way.
At least say "good bye."

And I'll never understand,
But I'll take it like a man.
I'm just wondering why you have to go.
And I just have this to say:

If you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
At least tell me why.
Don't' just walk away.
And if you're gonna go,
At least say "good bye."
Even if you have to cry.
Don't just leave this way.
At least say "good bye."
