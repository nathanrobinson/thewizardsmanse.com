So Ive been walking you to school everyday now for a month
And it feels like forever to me
And Ive been thinking if you want we can sneak away from here
And get out and see what we can see

So forget about your teachers
Forget about your books
Forget about your homework and PE
Forget about the lunchroom
Forget about your friends
Forget about everything but me
Because I wanna play hooky with you
I wanna run away and hide
I wanna take you for a drive
And I wanna play hooky with you

So Ive been thinking for a while
And thinking about you makes me smile
So I guess Ive been smiling a while too
Theres no reason why we cant sneak out for a day
And girl I wanna play hooky with you

So forget about your teachers
Forget about your books
Forget about your homework and PE
Forget about the lunchroom
Forget about your friends
Forget about everything but me
Because I wanna play hooky with you
I wanna run away and hide
I wanna take you for a drive
And I wanna play hooky with you

We can hide out in the movies
Or take a walk in the park
I dont care what it is we do
All I want is to be near you
And maybe hold your hand
And girl I wanna play hooky with you

So forget about your teachers
Forget about your books
Forget about your homework and PE
Forget about the lunchroom
Forget about your friends
Forget about everything but me
Because I wanna play hooky with you
I wanna run away and hide
I wanna take you for a drive
And I wanna play hooky with you

The classrooms are too crowded
And your friends all think Im lame
And we never talk once we get there
So I say we just skip school
At least just for a day
And this will be the day we can share

So forget about your teachers
Forget about your books
Forget about your homework and PE
Forget about the lunchroom
Forget about your friends
Forget about everything but me
Because I wanna play hooky with you
I wanna run away and hide
I wanna take you for a drive
And I wanna play hooky with you
