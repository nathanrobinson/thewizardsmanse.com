Don't look at me
Don't tell me lies
Don't torture me
With your pretty eyes
Don't say those things
You love to say
Don't play those games
You love to play

You lie to me
Lie to my face
You tell me that
Youll take out of this place
You never mean
Those things you say
Behind my back
You don't look at me

Don't break my heart
All over again
Don't play me now
Like some game to win
Don't use me now
Like you did before
Don't treat me like
Your little whore

You lie to me
Lie to my face
You tell me that
Youll take out of this place
You never mean
Those things you say
Behind my back
You don't look at me

You laugh at me
When Im not around
You tore out my heart
And left it on the ground

You lie to me
Lie to my face
You tell me that
Youll take out of this place
You never mean
Those things you say
Behind my back
You don't look at me
