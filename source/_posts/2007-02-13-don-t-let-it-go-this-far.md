Make up with your little lady.
Don't hang around this bar.
Go home before the sun goes down now,
Don't let it go this far.

I was a young, hard-headed child
I wouldn't listen to anyone
So I had me another beer then
I waited for all the fun.
Now twenty-some years later
I'm still sitting on this stool.
I lost my home when I lost my woman
By acting like a fool.
