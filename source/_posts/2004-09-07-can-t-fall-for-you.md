A thousand stories
A thousand songs
All said the same things
For way too long
But thats when you came
And changed it all
You said the old times
Would have to fall

But I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again
I can't fall for you
Cause you kill me in the end
I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again

A thousand hill sides
With greener grass
Could tempt a shepherd
To leave the pass
But then the wolves come
And eat the flock
Without a shepherd
They all are lost

So I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again
I can't fall for you
Cause you kill me in the end
I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again

A thousand heart beats
Beat just like mine
But then when He speaks
I find the time
And you would tempt me
To fall away
But you can't tell me
How Id be saved

So I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again
I can't fall for you
Cause you kill me in the end
I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again

I can't fall for you
The price is much too high
I can't fall for you
Cause in the end I die

So I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again
I can't fall for you
Cause you kill me in the end
I can't fall for you
Can't fall for you again
