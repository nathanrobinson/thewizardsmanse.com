Hey
You were a perfect child
Who
Thought you would be so wild
You
Just wanted to be loved
But it never felt like it should

There is a God
Who loves you
In spite of you
He never changes how He feels
He is waiting
Patiently
For you to call
That's when He proves that He is real

Hey
You have so much to do
Who
Thought youd ever be through
You
Just want to give it up
Cause you think youll never see love

There is a God
Who loves you
In spite of you
He never changes how He feels
He is waiting
Patiently
For you to call
That's when He proves that He is real

Hey
I feel so bad today
Who
Thought I had so much to say
I
Can't find the words to pray
So I just keep running away

There is a God
Who loves you
In spite of you
He never changes how He feels
He is waiting
Patiently
For you to call
That's when He proves that He is real

He sent His Son
Down to earth
To die for me
Just to make me a friend
If I call out
Hell pour His grace
Down on me
And His mercy will not end
