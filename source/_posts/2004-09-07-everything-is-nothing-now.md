Take away my pain and hide my fear
Swallow everything that I hold dear
Tell me that you love me say those lies
Never let me know what you feel inside

Everything is nothing now
Everything has lost it's glow
Everything is nothing now
Everything was just for show

Never let me look into your soul
Cause I would see that gaping hole
Never show the feelings that you lack
Never show your heart that is so black

Everything is nothing now
Everything has lost it's glow
Everything is nothing now
Everything was just for show

Although I try to save your precious life
I found nothing but your hatred and strife
So you say that you will be alright
But not if you have to see me another night

Everything is nothing now
Everything has lost it's glow
Everything is nothing now
Everything was just for show
