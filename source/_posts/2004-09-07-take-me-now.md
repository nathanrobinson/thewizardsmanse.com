Take me now into your heart
Promise me well never part
Take me now dont let me go
Well pretend that we dont know
Everything around us will fall down

Take me now take my future and my life
But dont take the pain that cuts through me like a knife
Take me now take me out of this town
Everything around us will fall down
Just take me now

Take me now and make me yours
My power comes when Im adored
Take me now Ill never leave
Never show me that I cant see
Everything around us will fall down

Take me now take my future and my life
But dont take the pain that cuts through me like a knife
Take me now take me out of this town
Everything around us will fall down
Just take me now

Take my pleasure take my pain
Take anything that you can claim
Take my fasion take my hell
Take anything that you can sell
Just take me now

Take me now take my future and my life
But dont take the pain that cuts through me like a knife
Take me now take me out of this town
Everything around us will fall down
Just take me now
