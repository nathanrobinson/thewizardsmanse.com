I never knew the good in you
Not because I never wanted to
I looked so hard and I waited so long
But I never found out what went wrong

D        G         Em          C
And you you never told me the truth
G         Em              C
You never told me what to do
Em               D      C
You never showed me the good in you
G         Em          C
You never told me the truth

I never knew who you were
I can't trust you anymore
Ive been hurting for so long
But I never found out what went wrong

And you you never told me the truth
You never told me what to do
You never showed the good in you
You never told me the truth

I told you I'd carry you home
Because I never want to be alone
But when we got there you ran away
And I just have one thing to say

And you you never told me the truth
You never told me what to do
You never showed the good in you
You never told me the truth
