There is a river
That's filled with blood.
Flows from the Savior.
It will fill you up.
When you go down in it
It'll wash you cleen
Yeah it'll wash you clean

I'm going to that river
That's filled with blood.
'gonna go down in it
So it can fill me up.
It'll wash me cleen
Yeah it'll wash me clean
It'll wash me cleen
Oh it'll wash me clean

There is a maan
Walking through this town.
Carries a Bible
As he walks around.
Talks about a river
That's filled with blood.
When you go down in it
It'll fill you up.
And it'll wash you cleen.
And It'll wash you clean.
It'll wash you cleen.
And it'll wash you clean.

Take me to that river
That's filled with blood.
'gonna go down in it
So it can fill me up.
It'll wash me cleen
Yeah it'll wash me clean
It'll wash me cleen
Oh it'll wash me clean

I saw the Savior
And the river of blood.
He said to go down in it
And it would fill me up.
And it washed me cleen.
Oh it washed me clean.

Join me in the river
Of the Savior's blood.
When you go down in it
It will fill you up.
And it'll wash you cleen.
And It'll wash you clean.
It'll wash you cleen.
Yeah it'll wash you clean.
