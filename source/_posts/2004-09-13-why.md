Why do I run from You?
Why do I look away?
Why can't I follow You?
Why does my flesh complain?
Why do You call to me?
Why do You say my name?
Why do you wash me clean,
And take away all my shame?

And why, do You still, love me?
And how, can a love, like this be?
And there, is no love, like yours,
So why, can't I follow, my Lord?
And where, is the stregnth, to run?
The strength, comes from, Your Son.
So why, do you still, love me?
It's because, it's Him, that You see.

Why do I stumble now?
Why can't I just serve you?
Why do I still fall down,
When I hope for Your will to do?
Why do You help me up,
Every time I fall?
Why do You show me love,
And hope that You'll be my all?

And why, do You still, love me?
And how, can a love, like this be?
And there, is no love, like yours,
So why, can't I follow, my Lord?
And where, is the stregnth, to run?
The strength, comes from, Your Son.
So why, do you still, love me?
It's because, it's Him, that You see.

How can I say You name
After the things I've done?
But You've taken all my blame
Ande replaced it with Your Son.
So How do I live for You,
When I can't forget the past?
The future must be my hope,
Or the rewards will be lost.

And why, do You still, love me?
And how, can a love, like this be?
And there, is no love, like yours,
So why, can't I follow, my Lord?
And where, is the stregnth, to run?
The strength, comes from, Your Son.
So why, do you still, love me?
It's because, it's Him, that You see.
