I've been praying for so long
And I need Your help just to carry on
Sometimes You're hard to see
But I cry out to You to carry me

I believe, I believe, I believe
That You'll come for me
And You'll comfort me
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe in You
That You will save me

I will lift my voice in Praise
I will glorify Your Holy Name
I will give you all my thanks
You have cared for me through all my days

I believe, I believe, I believe
That You'll come for me
And You'll comfort me
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe in You
That You will save me

People sometimes see me fall
But I still look to You my all in all
I will always seek your face
Because you've showered me with Your grace

I believe, I believe, I believe
That You'll come for me
And You'll comfort me
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe in You
That You will save me
I believe
