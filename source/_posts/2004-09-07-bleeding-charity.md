Another life is fading
Another hope is lost
I know its not worth taking
But I don't know what it cost
So can you feel my sorrow
My pain is clear to see
But I don't have much hope for
Your bleeding charity

So where is your bleeding charity
I need your bleeding charity
When Im lying dieing
And curled up and crying
I know I need your bleeding charity

Another hurtful moment
You always cut me down
Another wasted life spent
Proving you have not grown
So you can't steel my heart now
I give it away for free
I still don't have much hope for
Your bleeding charity

So where is your bleeding charity
I need your bleeding charity
When Im lying dieing
And curled up and crying
I know I need your bleeding charity
