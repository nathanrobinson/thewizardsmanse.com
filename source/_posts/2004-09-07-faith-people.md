Faith people
Seeing without eyes
Faith people
Touching peoples lives
God fearing people
Trusting the unseen
Faith people
Praising the one that made them clean
Faith people

Ive been around the world and I have seen
Many people living many way
But of all the people the ones that do the most
Are the ones that like by faith

Faith people
Seeing without eyes
Faith people
Touching peoples lives
God fearing people
Trusting the unseen
Faith people
Praising the one that made them clean
Faith people

No matter what happens in their lives
They always have peace and hope
Because they meet every circumstance with faith
And faith is what helps them cope

Faith people
Seeing without eyes
Faith people
Touching peoples lives
God fearing people
Trusting the unseen
Faith people
Praising the one that made them clean
Faith people

They can wait in hope for someone they've never seen
And know with faith that all these things will someday be

Faith people
Seeing without eyes
Faith people
Touching peoples lives
God fearing people
Trusting the unseen
Faith people
Praising the one that made them clean
Faith people
