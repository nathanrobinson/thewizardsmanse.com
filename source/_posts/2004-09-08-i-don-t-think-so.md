You beat me up and you let me down.
You chased me all around this town.
You never stop trying to hurt me now.

Why do you still try to talk to me?
Is there something that I can't see?
Will you ever just let me be?

I don't think so, I don't think so.
I don't think you just said what you said.
I don't think you want me dead.
I don't think you'd kick me out of bed.
I don't think so, I don't think so.

You piss me off but you turn me on.
You just laugh when I sing my songs.
I can't help but beg 'cause it's been so long.

Why do I fall in love with you?
You're nothing like the girl I once knew.
Isn't there something I can do?

I don't think so, I don't think so.
I don't think you just said what you said.
I don't think you want me dead.
I don't think you'd kick me out of bed.
I don't think so, I don't think so.

So I'll go on trying to fight this fight
But I know I'm wrong to think I'll win this fight.
Isn't there some way I can find the light?

I don't think so, I don't think so.
I don't think you just said what you said.
I don't think you want me dead.
I don't think you'd kick me out of bed.
I don't think so, I don't think so.

I don't think so, I don't think so.
I don't think you just said what you said.
I don't think you want me dead.
I don't think you'd kick me out of bed.
I don't think so, I don't think so.
