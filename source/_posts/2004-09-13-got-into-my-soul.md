Every time I look into your eyes
I think you know exactly what I feel inside.
I don't want to live without your love.
I don't ever want to give you up.

Because you
Have got into my soul,
And I think you made me whole.
And you
Can fill me up inside,
And you give me a new life.
And I think you made me whole.

Every time you look into my eyes
I think you know exactly what I have to hide.
There's no part of me that you don't know.
I don't want to ever let you go.

Because you
Have got into my soul,
And I think you made me whole.
And you
Can fill me up inside,
And you give me a new life.
And I think you made me whole.

Tell me once again.
Say you love me now.
Is there anything I can do,
To show you how I feel,
Or prove that I'm for real?

Because you
Have got into my soul,
And I think you made me whole.
And you
Can fill me up inside,
And you give me a new life.
And I think you made me whole.
