Rescue me oh God,
Please save me from myself.
I feel so trapped inside,
So I call to You for help.

I feel so trapped inside.
I don't know what to do.
I've got no place to hide,
So I'm crying out to you.

Rescue me oh God,
From this enemy within.
Show me how to live,
And overcome my sin.

I feel so trapped inside.
I don't know what to do.
I've got no place to hide,
So I'm crying out to you.

Rescue my oh God,
You are my only hope.
I call upon Your name,
Because I don't know how to cope.
	   
I feel so trapped inside.
I don't know what to do.
I've got no place to hide,
So I'm crying out to you.
