She whispered gently
Into his ear
A little lie
To ease his fear
Then she slipped out
She was on her way
Let him find out
Another day

He's the fallen one
He's been left behind
He's the fallen one
But he don't mind
He's the fallen one
He's got hell to pay
He's the fallen one
With nothing left to say

She said she loved him.
He didn't care.
She always lied
Whenever she'd share.
He closed his eyes
And quoted a prayer.
He knew she'd be gone
When he needed her there.

He's the fallen one
He's been left behind
He's the fallen one
But he don't mind
He's the fallen one
He's got hell to pay
He's the fallen one
With nothing left to say

He knew he loved her.
He knew she wouldn't stay.
He needed to find
A new love today.

He's the fallen one
He's been left behind
He's the fallen one
But he don't mind
He's the fallen one
He's got hell to pay
He's the fallen one
With nothing left to say
